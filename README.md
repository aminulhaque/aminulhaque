**Technical Director @ SkyHawk Solutions**

Hi, I'm Aminul Haque, a frontend developer and designer with a focus on WordPress. I'm passionate about building clean, responsive websites and applications. Recently, I’ve ventured into React development and AI-driven coding, learning how to leverage artificial intelligence to build apps.

## About Me
I specialize in frontend development and design, with a strong emphasis on WordPress. My journey has recently expanded into the world of AI-assisted coding, where I use artificial intelligence to build and improve web applications. I believe that AI can amplify my abilities and help me deliver solutions more efficiently, but I also value maintaining full ownership of the code I write—this is why I avoid no-code tools like Bubble.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy going on road trips and working on DIY projects. I love solving problems and finding creative solutions, whether it’s in technology or everyday life.

## Interests
- Road trips & travel
- DIY projects
- Web development and emerging technologies
- Problem-solving and tinkering
- AI in coding and app development
